# ScalaBFS Graph Data Preprocess Usage



## Introduction of Input and Output Graph Data Format



## Convert Undirected Graph to Directed Graph [optional]

Usage:

```bash
[executable program] [filename without suffix]
```

Example:

```bash
g++ transfer.cpp -o transfer
```

```bash
./transfer soc-livejournal
```

## Generate Divided Graph Data with Scalable Channels and PEs

Usage: 

```bash
[executable program] [filename with suffix] [the number of channels] [the number of PEs]
```

Example:

```bash
g++ GraphToScalaBFS.cpp -o GraphToScalaBFS
```

```bash
./GraphToScalaBFS soc-livejournal.txt 32 64
```

the process above means we generate
