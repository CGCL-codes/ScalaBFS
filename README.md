# ScalaBFS: A Scalable BFS Accelerator on FPGA-HBM Platform

## Organization

The code for ScalaBFS using Chisel language is located in src/ directory. Vitis project is located in ScalaBFS-proj/ directory after unpacked. Graph data processing files are provided in preprocess/ directory.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

This project works on [Xilinx U280 Data Center Accelerator card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html).

### Operation System

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### Software

[Vitis 2019.2](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis/2019-2.html)

[U280 Package File on Vitis 2019.2](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html#gettingStarted)

Notice:

1. After the installation of xdma and update the shell on alveo card manually(under normal circumstances , the command is shown in the process of the installtion of xdma. If not , you can use command "/opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt flash --update"), you should cold reboot your machine. The cold reboot means that you should shutdown your machine , unplug the power , wating for several minutes , plug the power and boot up your machine.You can use command 

```
/opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt flash --scan
/opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbutil validate
```

to make sure that the runtime enviroment and the alveo card is ready.

2. Don't forget to add the xrt and Vitis to your PATH. Typically you can 

```
source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
source /tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2019.2/settings64.sh
```

You can also add this two commands to your .bashrc file.If in the process of making ScalaBFS you fail and see "make: vivado: Command not found", you very likely ignored this step.

3. If you meet "PYOPENCL INSTALL FAILED" in the installtion of xrt , refer to [AR# 73055](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/73055.html)

4. If you meet "XRT Requires opencl header" when you open Vitis , refer to [Vitis prompt â€œXRT Requires opencl header"](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Vitis-Acceleration-SDAccel-SDSoC/Vitis-prompt-XRT-Requires-opencl-header-quot/td-p/1087072)
### Environment

To compile chisel code, you need to install:

- Java 1.0.8

```
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
sudo apt-get install java-wrappers    
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

- sbt 1.4.2

```
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | \
sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \
--recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
```

- Scala 2.11.12

```
sudo apt install scala
```

## Clone and Build 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lizardll/ScalaBFS.git
$ make
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Preprocess

Before deploying and running ScalaBFS, we need to make sure that you have specific graph data with divided csc-csr format that ScalaBFS required.  For complete graph data preprocess guide, see [Data Preprocess.](https://github.com/lizardll/ScalaBFS/tree/master/data_preprocess)

We start with a small directed graph named Wiki-Vote for example. First we should make for directed or undirected graph for propose. Then we generate divided graph data with 32 channels and 64 PEs for ScalaBFS.

```bash
cd data_preprocess
make all
./GraphToScalaBFS Wiki-Vote.txt 32 64
```



### Deploy and play

#### Open Vitis & Select workspace:

  ```
  ScalaBFS-proj/workspace
  ```

#### Choose graph data (modify host_example.cpp in vitis)

For the preprocessed wiki-vote graph data mentioned before, we should first modify the input file name at line 121:

  ```
  string bfs_filename = "YOUR_DIR_HERE/ScalaBFS/data_preprocess/Wiki-Vote_pe_64_ch_";
  ```

Then we have to modify the following line 122-127 according to data_preprocess/Wiki-Vote_addr_pe_64_ch_32.log:

  ```
    cl_uint csr_c_addr = 260;
    cl_uint csr_r_addr = 0;
    cl_uint level_addr = 2958;
    cl_uint node_num = 8298;
    cl_uint csc_c_addr = 1780;
    cl_uint csc_r_addr = 1520;
  ```
  
After that, it's time to build the whole project in vitis. Selecting the "Hardware" target in the left down corner, and then build it! Genarally it will take 10~15 hours.
